surroundsync
============

##Mostly working edition using Firebase
- Slightly dependant on network speeds and Firebase latency
- Works with 2 devices(not tested on anything other than desktop/laptop)
- Cannot replicate issue with song randomly not starting sometimes

##Possible improvements
- Switch to Node and Socket.io to avoid client syncing
- Stream from own source
